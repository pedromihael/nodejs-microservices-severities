# Severities Service

This is part of a nodejs microservices project built to compose a partial grade of distributed systems, a discipline of my software engineering grad.

The point here is to use the `express-http-proxy` lib to deal with redirections based on the `req.path`, assuming that every endpoint starts with it's microservice name. See the [api-gateway](https://github.com/pedromihael/nodejs-microservices-api-gateway).

### You'll need docker and docker-compose to run this api gateway.

Run `docker-compose up` and wait to the service to be up.
